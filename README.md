## Now what does this cost?

Nothing, I am promising that Suma-Launcher, including all it's features, will always be free.

## How to Contribute?

Contributing to Suma-Launcher is pretty straightforward! Fork the project, clone your fork and start coding!
Before implementing any new big features I would be happy if you could either hit me up in via a GitHub issue. I probably won't reject it.
